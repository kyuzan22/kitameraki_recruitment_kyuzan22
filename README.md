## Welcome to Muhammad Dzikri Qomaruzzaman's Kitameraki Recruitment Assessment!

Thank you for your interest in my project! This repository contains the code for a frontend-backend application that I built as part of the recruitment process for Kitameraki. Below are the steps to get the app up and running on your local machine.

### Step-by-Step Guide:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Clone this Git repository to your local machine using the following command:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/kyuzan22/kitameraki_recruitment_kyuzan22.git
     ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory and Switch to the Active Project Branch:**
   - Enter the project directory using the following command:
     ```
     cd kitameraki_recruitment_kyuzan22
     ```

   - Ensure you're in the correct branch by switching to `part_one` branch:
     ```
     git checkout part_one
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Navigate to the backend directory:
     ```
     cd backend
     ```
   - Install backend dependencies:
     ```
     npm install
     ```

   - Navigate to the frontend/manage-my-task directory:
     ```
     cd ../frontend/manage-my-task
     ```
   - Install frontend dependencies:
     ```
     npm install
     ```

4. **Run the Servers:**
   - In the `backend` directory, start the backend server by running:
     ```
     node server.js
     ```

   - Then, in the `frontend/manage-my-task` directory, start the frontend development server by running:
     ```
     npm run dev
     ```

5. **Access the Application:**
   - Once both servers are running, open your web browser and navigate to the following address:
     ```
     http://localhost:5173/
     ```
   - This should display the frontend of the application, and you can now interact with it locally.

That's it! You should now have the frontend-backend application up and running on your machine. If you encounter any issues or have any questions, feel free to reach out. Happy coding! ðŸš€
